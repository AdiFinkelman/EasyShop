## Features
### 1. User Authentication
Users can register an account with their email and password. Existing users can log in to access their accounts.
### 2. Create List
In the "Create List" section, users can choose a category and select items within that category. 

For each item, users can specify the quantity they need. The app will display the selected items with updated quantities and prices.

Once you have finished selecting the items in a category, you can save them to your personal list.

Saving the selected items ensures that your list is readily accessible across devices and persists even when switching accounts.

To save the selected items into your constant list, simply click the "Save to My List" button. 
### 3. My List
The "My List" section offers a comprehensive view of your saved constant list. 

Your list is securely stored in real-time using Firebase, ensuring accessibility across devices and persisting even when switching accounts. 

Need to remove an item? No problem! Simply click on it to delete it from your list.
### 4. Map - Nearby Supermarkets
Navigate your way to nearby supermarkets with the interactive "Map" feature.

The app displays supermarkets in your vicinity on a user-friendly Google Map. 

Each supermarket is marked, allowing you to quickly identify the nearest options. 

Clicking on a marker reveals the supermarket's name, and with a single tap, you can seamlessly launch Google Maps for step-by-step navigation.
